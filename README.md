# NTO-iPhone-App
An informational app I created in 2015 for NTO, a region of a worldwide youth group. This was in my early days, so I can definetly see some amatuer coding style in there, but I was proud of creating something people in the group enjoyed using.

## Acknowledgements
As with my Plano Band app, I thank Paul Solt and his Intro to Swift course for teaching me the fundamentals of Apple's IDE and language.
